# Welcome to the StringEncryptor3000!



### Hello This program is intended to be a lightweight string encryptor using python, very simple and easy to write. The purpose of this program is for a program that will take any string and then encrypt it with AES encryption, the program will also rememeber all encryptions done along with the keys to decrypt later stored in the data2 JSON file in the program folder. this is a great tool if you have any sensitive text saved in plain-text and would like a safer option to store those or would just like a way to encrypt and decrypt random strings for any reason.

### ill be looking to improve upon the program in the future for now this is the first iteration.
